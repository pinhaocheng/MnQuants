**Overview**

This project is intended to give members hands-on experience with the process of generating trading strategies, backtesting them, and measuring risk-adjusted returns. We will test out various high-timeframe strategies and attempt to come up with our own strategies to get a feel for both the technical and creative processes of quantitative research.

In this notebook, we will utilize the candlestick pattern recognition feature of the TA-lib technical analysis library to find positions where we can LONG or SHORT the underlying ticker.
