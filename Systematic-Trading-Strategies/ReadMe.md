# Systematic Trading Strategies

**Overview**

This project is intended to give members hands-on experience with the process of generating trading strategies, backtesting them, and measuring risk-adjusted returns.

We will test out various high-timeframe strategies and attempt to come up with our own strategies to get a feel for both the technical and creative processes of quantitative research.
